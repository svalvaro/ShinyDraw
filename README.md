# ShinyDraw

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ShinyDraw is a combination of three neural network trained with
thousands of pictures of the alphabet. It is able to accurately
recognize the letter that youâ€™ve written.

It is my personal project for the RaukR course in advanced R.

It is a combination of R code and python. And linked together through
the reticulate library.
